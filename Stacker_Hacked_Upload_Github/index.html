                        <p>We think it is important to have someone to talk to about your stammering. Although this can feel embarrassing, it is much worse trying to deal with it on your own.</p>
                        <p>It does seem a bit strange that no one mentions stammering. The reason for this now seems very old-fashioned: many parents were told that they should try to "ignore their child's stammering and it would go away", or that "if you draw attention to it, you might make it worse". This idea has unfortunately lasted for a long time, but it is very unhelpful.</p>

                        <p>You may just keep repeating ("p-p-p-p-please"), sometimes the whole word is repeated ("my-my-my-my-my name is")</p>
                        <p>You may also find that a sound just keeps on going and you can't move on to the next bit of the word, "ssssssssee what I mean?"  It is a bit like stretching a sound out</p>
                        <p>Perhaps you find that the word or the beginning sound gets completely stuck, and nothing comes out at all "!!!". When this happens, the other person might not even know that you are trying to speak. It can be very frustrating and embarrassing</p>
                        <p>Stammering interrupts talking. It is like tripping up in your own mouth and sometimes, like tripping up, you can "save yourself" and sometimes it feels impossible</p>
                        <p>It feels as if you can't help it - it just happens - sometimes it happens without any warning and other times it happens on particular words or at important moments</p>
                        <p>You may have developed clever tricks to stop it happening. For example, finding a different word that isn't so hard or putting an extra word or sound in first. At other times you might just avoid the word or the situation altogether</p>
                        <p>Whatever you do you may be trying to stop the stammer getting in your way</p>
                        <p>Stammering can be very tiring. It takes a lot of energy (both physical and mental), your breathing can be difficult and you may find that you tense up some muscles in your neck, mouth, chest or hands and body</p>
                        <p>It is often embarrassing and frustrating, and you may find that in some situations you get nervous about speaking</p>

                        <p>We don't really know yet. Scientists have been working for years to try and find out whether there is a cause and whether there is a cure. One thing that is agreed is that the problem is highly complicated.</p>
                        <p>Stammering is probably not caused by one single thing for a person - it is more likely that it is the result of very many factors. More importantly, the ingredients of stammering are probably different for every person who has a stammer. And the things that help stammering may be slightly different for everyone too.</p>
                        <p>Maybe you think that other people will be feeling sorry for you or, worse still, that some people might find it funny. Sometimes you may even think that you know exactly what others are thinking. That will make you try harder to stop the stammering and of course the harder you try to stop the stammer, the worse it usually gets. This is called a vicious cycle. Most people who stammer will know this feeling</p>

                        <p>Irrum (aged 10) was referred to the Centre by her parents. She had had some speech and language therapy both in Year 2 and Year 4 but the stammering was still a big problem and the family was becoming very concerned about how she would cope with the move to secondary school.<br /><br />During the assessment, Irrum described the worries that she had every day about answering the register, reading aloud and answering questions. Some of the children in her class had made fun of her by imitating her stammering, both in the classroom and in the playground. The teacher told them off but they didn't take any notice. Irrum told us that she had stopped putting her hand up and sometimes complained of a sore tummy or headache when she knew that she would have to speak aloud in front of the class. Irrum really wanted to be in the school play but was too frightened to volunteer.<br /><br />Irrum came on an intensive course for two weeks with her parents in the Easter holidays. Her younger brother also came for one day so that he could see what was happening too. There were eight children in the children's group and their parents went into a separate group.<br /><br />Irrum and her parents were delighted with the course. They told us how important it had been to them as a family. They now understood why stammering is such a complicated problem and why it had been so difficult for Irrum in the past. Irrum now knows what to do when things feel difficult, she has lots of fluency tips to use in class and with friends and her parents have practical ways of supporting her when necessary, and they know that they can leave her to get on with things when that is important.<br /><br />Irrum was in the school play at the end of term, she has now started her new school and the news so far is good. The family still keeps in touch with the others in the group and they still meet regularly.<br /><br />They also know that they can come back to us for a top-up whenever necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; Set-backs and blips are normal. &nbsp;We expect this to happen so make use of us when you need us! Irrum still comes in from time to time to go over things again or talk about any new problems she is experiencing. &nbsp;</p>
